Chunk Generation Events:

To counteract the downside of the difficulty of deserts and jungles - maybe even oceans

on chunk generate:
      biome at player is desert
            set inventory of block
                  if block is chest
                        add random {_wtf.chest.list}
      biome at player is jungle
            set inventory of block
                  if block is chest
                        add random {_wtf.chest.list}
      biome at player is ocean
            {perhaps add a treasure in the bottom of the ocean}
      biome at player is deep ocean
            {perhaps add in a sunken ship and treasure}
            
-------------------------------------

Ocean | Deep Ocean Event:

If location of player is (biome ocean or biome deep ocean)
      set {jaz.%player%} = 1
      while {jaz.%player%} = 1
            pick a random number between 1-200
                  if the number is 50 or 100 or 150 or 200 send 'Fish are swarming around you.' to player
                  if the number is 25 or 75 or 125 or 175 send 'A shark is after you' to player
                        wait 10 seconds
                              if location of player is (biome ocean or biome deep ocean)
                                    damage player by 4 hearts
                                    send 'The shark just bit you, luckily it swam away.' to player
                              if location of player is not (biome ocean or biome deep ocean)
                                    send 'Whew, you avoided the shark...' to player
            wait 20 seconds
If location of player is not (biome ocean or biome deep ocean)
      set {jaz.%player%} = 0
      
--------------------------------------

Power Outage Event (suggestible)

If lightning strikes near you - if lamps are nearby - flicker them on and off - 
and say to anyone in range 'your power is flickering' ... 

if the lamps flicker and the message is sent .... pick a random number between 1-10

if the number is 5 .... turn the lamps out completely.

and then say 'your power just went out'


alternatively instead of lightning - if you can have it so if rain touches a torch*

replace torch with a custom item ... with id 75 (unlit redstone torch) ....so it can be separate 
from regular unlit/lit redstone torches

and then on break of block - if block is that custom item ... destroy it .... and replace it with regular torch

--but* the only way to do this without block updating .... and i'm not even sure if it will work or not ... is the

on physics event ... if block updating is included - then maybe you can disable it :)
