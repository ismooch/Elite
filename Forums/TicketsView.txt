Please read the TicketsPage and TicketsHistory as well.

We need to make a system to upload people's tickets to an online-based database ... 

and if the person on the forum's name is 'blank' then display their tickets amount as 'blank.amount'

on their profile (for just them) and on the main page under their avatar.
