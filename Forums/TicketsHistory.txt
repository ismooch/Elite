Please read the TicketsView and TicketsPage as well.

We need to make an online database to show the player's current tickets and the history of their tickets,

how they obtained them, who or what system it came from, the time the money was added or deducted, 

and the current amount at the time it was added or removed.

examples)

150 tickets were added by voting on planet minecraft | 4/12/2014 7:14:23pm | New Balance: 24750
25 tickets were removed by leaving the kit pvp arena | 4/12/2014 7:12:50pm | New Balance: 24600

{_amount.difference.%player%.%now%} if difference is lower say 'were removed' if difference is higher say 'were added'

{_ticket.main.area.reasons.%player%.%now%} which is 'by leaving' ... 

and the system the reason was for {_ticket.main.area.%player%.%now%}


-the system will list all of these according to the %player% being equal to the website player

-the system will list all of these on the history page according to adding a %now% - and keeping 

that value on a database - adding each value to a seperate area, instead of updating it.

-the system will also list the %now% in the tickets history - to visually show when it occured.

- the system will also show the {_amount.total.%player%.%now%} at the time of the ticket update.

---------------

all of the variables here - most likely will not occur in a minecraft database - we'll have to

probably upload them somewhere online ....

---------------

On the website, if someone has set permission - we also need to add a search feature for some staff members

so if a problem occurs we will have record of the player's tickets, and will be able to assess the situation accordingly
